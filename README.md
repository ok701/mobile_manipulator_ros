## Overview
This project presents a lightweight mobile manipulator integrated with a VR headset to enhance telepresence. The manipulator features:
- Six degrees of freedom.
- 3D-printed components.
- A Quasi-Direct Drive (QDD) motor for efficient and lightweight design.

## Motion Control
1. **Compliance Control**: Enhances adaptability and safety during interaction with dynamic environments by combining task-space control with joint-level compliance strategies.
2. **CoM Stabilization**: Ensures balance for integration with quadruped robots.
3. **Gravity Compensation**: Reduces motion errors and enhances stability.
4. **VR Headset Control**: Maps VR headset orientation to manipulator motion using quaternion-based PD control.

This research is supported by the "Police Lab 2.0 Project" (Project No. 210121M05), funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT and the National Police Agency.
